                    <p>The desire to learn will lead to knowledge creation and expand one's capacity for creativity.

                        Learning is not a process that happens in a coercive environment. Learning is a process that
                        must start from one's desire. When in that state of desire, it's important to understand the
                        intuition, ask why, go deeper into the why, further understand the intuition of the why, all the
                        way down to the bottom, until you have the explanation grounded in you, akin to the roots of a
                        tree. Out of this tree, something beautiful grows: Your knowledge can now be applied and related
                        to an infinite number of things, regardless of the subject matter. This is the relation between
                        learning and creativity.
