                <h1>Learning</h1>
                <p class="date">December 4, 2025</p>
                <article>
                    <p>In the past year I've learned about learning. I've learned that learning and the desire to
                        learn will lead to both personal growth and knowledge creation. I've also learned
                        that learning is not a process that takes place in a coercive environment. Learning is a process
                        which must start from one's own desire and creativity. I've learned that when in that place of
                        desire it's important to take a concept, understand the intuition, ask why, go deeper into that
                        why, and further understand the intuition of the why, all the way down to the bottom, when you
                        have the explanation fully grounded in you like the roots of a tree. Out of this tree something
                        beautiful flowers. Your knowledge can now be applied and related to an infinite numbers of
                        things, regardless of the subject matter. This is learning and creativity. The ability to
                        understand and connect ideas knows no bounds. </p>
